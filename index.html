        <div class="row">
            <p><strong>What:</strong> PTS is a mental health condition that occurs after the exposure or experience of a
                traumatic event
                or series of traumatic events such as war, accidents, violence, death, abuse, etc.</p>
            <p><strong>Who:</strong></p>
            <p>In the past, PTSD was mostly in relation to war veterans and was known as “shell shock” or “combat
                fatigue”. Now, researchers understanding PTSD can affect all people, of any ethnicity, nationality,
                culture, or age. The World Health Organization conducted a worldwide survey and found that 70.4% of the
                respondents experienced lifetime traumas (Kessler, 2017). In the United States, about 8% of people will
                have PTSD some time in their lives. However, different groups are disproportionately affected. Women are
                twice as likely to experience PTSD than men and U.S. Latino, African American, and First Nations people
                have higher rates of PTSD than white people. PTSD is also prevalent in the LGBTQ+ community and is
                reported much higher than national studies done on the general public (Alessi, 2013). Particularly,
                visibly gender non-conforming people are significantly more vulnerable to violence and discrimination,
                which can lead to PTSD (Reisner, 2016). Children and young adults in the U.S. also experience PTSD with
                a percentage as high as 15%. Check out our blog entry on PTS in the media to get a better understanding
                of the possible reasons why some communities are disproportionately affected more than others.</p>

            <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong></p>
            <p>While many experience traumatizing events and PTS, not everyone will develop chronic PTSD. To diagnose
                adults, medical doctors use a diagnostic criterion called the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
                Mental Disorders (DSM-5). According to the DSM-5, symptoms can begin within three months to a few years
                after the event. Symptoms include intrusion symptoms, avoidance, negative alterations in cognition and
                mood, and alteration in arousal and reactivity (Brainline).<br>
                <strong>Intrusion</strong> symptoms include re-experiencing the traumatic event through memories,
                nightmares, or
                flashbacks. <strong>Avoidance</strong> is defined as avoiding thoughts or feelings related to the trauma
                or avoiding
                places, events or objects that could be a reminder of the trauma. <strong>Cognition and mood
                    alterations</strong> can
                include inability to remember key features of the trauma, increase in negative thoughts, feelings of
                blame, guilt, or isolation, and decreased interest in activities. Lastly, <strong>alterations in arousal
                    and
                    reactivity</strong> involve irritability or aggression, risky or destructive behavior, increased
                alertness,
                difficulty concentrating, and difficulty sleeping. After a traumatic event, it is normal to experience
                symptoms for a few weeks but once they exceed over a month it could be diagnosed as PTSD. Additionally,
                children and adolescents may react differently to traumatic events than adults. Children under 6 years
                old may wet their bed, forget how to or unable to talk, or become unusually clingy with a parent or
                adult. Older children and teens are more likely to show symptoms similar to adults. To get a better
                understanding of these symptoms, check out our entry on personal experiences for examples.

            <p>Everyone is unique in regards to their symptoms so treatment may differ between survivors. The most
                common treatment includes cognitive processing therapy (CPT), prolonged exposure therapy (PE), or
                stress inoculation training (SIT) (PTSD Facts). CPT aims to help the patient identify how they view
                themselves, others, and the world around them in relation to the trauma and use that new perspective
                to create constructive ways of thinking. PE is a gradual process that helps individuals confront the
                trauma-related memories and emotions in a safe and guided environment. Lastly, SIT is about teaching
                coping skills to deal with the stress that comes with PTSD. SIT can include breathing exercises,
                muscle relaxation, cognitive restructuring, and assertiveness skills. For children, studies show
                Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT) is best (Bastien, 2020). TF-CBT is more or less
                a combination of the three therapies mentioned above. The most common medication for PTSD is
                selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which are antidepressants used to ease depressed
                mood and anxiety. Complementary and alternative treatments can be effective as well, such as
                transcranial magnetic stimulation, acupuncture, relaxation techniques, and meditation (Wahbeh,
                2014).<br>

                PTS and other stress and trauma related disorders are the most prevalent mental illnesses that
                affect us today. However, PTSD is a treatable condition and hopefully with these resources you can

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-6">
                <p>Post-Traumatic Stress, also known as PTS, is a psychological problem that can occur after
                    experiencing or
                    witnessing a traumatic event. A traumatic event includes a sense of horror, helplessness, serious
                    injury, or
                    a fear that your life or others’ lives are in danger. A traumatic event is subjective but the event
                    can
                    include a natural disaster, military/war combat, a major accident, violence, abuse, death, sexual
                    assault,
                    racism, or discrimination. PTS is a common, normal reaction to a traumatic event however;
                    Post-Traumatic
                    Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a medically diagnosed condition with more severe and persistent PTS
                    symptoms.
                    Throughout this blog we will be using PTS and PTSD interchangeably to help deviate away from the
                    stereotypes
                    and stigmatization associated with PTSD. Also, please note if you or a loved one exhibits any of
                    these
                    symptoms, it’s important to acknowledge you are not at fault for the traumatizing events experienced
                    or the
                    way you cope with the stress. We recommend being tested by your healthcare provider as soon as
                    possible
                    before symptoms might get worse. </p>
